#Random Sentinels#

This is an Android app to quickly and randomly choose heroes, a villain, and an
environment for playing the board game [_Sentinels of the Multiverse_](http://www.sentinelsofthemultiverse.com) by Greater Than Games.
Usage is simple: just set the number of heroes you want and press the button. The app does the rest.
You can set which expansions you have in the app settings.

Sentinels for educational purposes and because I personally find it useful.
