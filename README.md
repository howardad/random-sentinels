#Random Sentinels#

This is (going to be) an Android app to quickly and randomly choose heroes, a villain, and an
environment for playing the board game _Sentinels of the Multiverse_ by Greater Than Games.
Usage is simple: just set the number of heroes you want and press the button. The app does the rest.
You can set which expansions you have in the app settings (not yet implemented).
